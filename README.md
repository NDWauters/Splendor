# Splendor

Well known card game with nobles, gems and development cards.

I created this project together with three fellow students as an assignment for my first year of Applied Computer Science at HOGent for the course Software Development. 

To make the application work, the necessary JARs need to be included in the project. These libraries are "JUnit", "JavaFX", and "MySQL" (Database). Additionally, a connection string needs to be filled in the "Connectie.java" file
